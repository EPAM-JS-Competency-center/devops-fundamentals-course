# Important org notes:

_Using [GitFlow WorkFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) to deliver changes to your project is highly recommended._

_We suggest you make [conventional commits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/config-conventional) and commit linting in every app and repository, you work with during this course._

_You can use the [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky/v/4.3.8) npm package to set up appropriate git hooks in your project._

_Please, share access to your repository with your mentor, expert, or other students in your group (if necessary)._

_When the task is done, submit a pull request (PR) and request a review from your mentor, expert, or other mentees from your group (if necessary)._

_Duplicate PR’s link and attach it to [Learn Portal](https://learn.epam.com/) when you submit your work for review._

_Attach some screenshots of your work/app along with PR’s link to show:_
- the code or configuration of your solution
- the inputs and outputs of your script/solution
- any related links or sources
- you can optionally provide some video screen captures with your solution

_Notify your mentor, expert, or other mentees from your group when work is done and ready for review (if necessary)._

_Prepare questions beforehand to ask during a group Q&A session with a mentor or expert._

_If you spin some Cloud resources while solving the lab's tasks, terminate them after reporting the results in Learn portal to avoid additional or unexpected charges._
