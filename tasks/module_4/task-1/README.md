# PR Instructions

## Task 1

In the first task, a name conflict occurred, so you can find a folder named `task-1` (instead of `task_1`) within the `tasks` directory, which contains a submodule `module_4`.

## Task 2

For the second task, you need to update your `.bashrc` file to match the one in this PR and specify the correct path in the `disk_space_monitor.sh` file.

## Task 3

To check the third task, simply run the script named `count_files.sh`.
