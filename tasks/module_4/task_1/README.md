### Note:

1. **Create** a new directory named **task_1** in the projectâ€™s **module_4** directory.
2. **Create** a shell script that will watch free disk space. The bash script should follow watch the free space of your hard disks and warns you when that free space drops below a given threshold.
   The value of the threshold is given by the user as a command line argument. Notice that if the program gets no command line argument, a default value is used as the threshold.
