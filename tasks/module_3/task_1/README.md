# Task 1: Set up a Linux/Ubuntu virtual machine (VM)

1. [Install virtualization software](https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMLOCALIT/Virtual+Machine+creation+using+Oracle+VM+VirtualBox) ([Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html), [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/), etc.) on your PC.
2. Set up a VM with [Ubuntu](https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMLOCALIT/How+to+deploy+EPAM+Ubuntu+image+%28automatically%29+to+a+virtual+machine) or other [Linux distribution](https://www.educba.com/linux-distributions/) based on your preference.

##### _NB: Creating an Ubuntu VM with VirtualBox on **Windows 10** **tips** and **troubleshooting**_:

- **System Requirements for Ubuntu 18/20**:
  - 2 GHz dual-core processor;
  - 4 GiB RAM (but 1 GiB can work);
  - 25 GB of hard-drive space;
  - VGA capable of 1024Ã—768 screen resolution.
- In case installation takes too long, or at some point screen frozen, or any actions are not performed, stop running session, go to setting and try to increase base memory and processors count, then restart VM.
- In some cases, it is helpful to disable **Virtual Machine Platform** Windows feature.
- Also, it is possible for testing purposes to use Ubuntu ISO from [official site](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) instead EPAM&#39;s ISO, as last takes too much more time for installation and running, then official one.
